# PluginBase serialization demonstrated via a mini game module framework

### Please do not use this directly in your software as this is not a fully functional game framework, only a mini-framework. The user is meant to reimplement this version of the framework to their liking

Classes are well documented, good luck understanding how things work, though I have a feeling it shouldn't take too long. :)
